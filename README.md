# Interactive Learning Paths

An interactive, graph-like web application for exploring multiple learning paths. This project provides a dynamic interface for visualizing and navigating various learning paths such as:

- **LeaP1 (Learning Path 1 - Beginner: Technical)**
- **LeaP2 (Learning Path 2 - Advanced: Technical)**
- **FreeP (Freelance Path)**
- **BP (Business Path)**

Each learning path page includes clickable nodes that reveal detailed information about each step in the path. The project uses the [vis-network](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/) library (loaded via a CDN) to create interactive network graphs.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Visualization:** Explore learning paths as interactive, clickable graphs.
- **Dynamic Step Details:** Click on individual nodes to view step details.
- **Easy Navigation:** Use the navigation menu or the graph nodes to jump between different learning paths.
- **Responsive Design:** Works across various devices and screen sizes.s
